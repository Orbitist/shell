<p>Located in the City of Dunkirk, Dunkirk Harbor is easy to access, and facilities, including restrooms, convenience stores and restaurants, are all nearby. The main pier, reached by turning toward the lake off NY 5 at Central Avenue in Dunkirk, is the main vantage point for birdwatching. From the pier, scan the water and both inner and outer breakwaters, using binoculars or ideally a spotting scope. Other good vantage points include Memorial Park (west of the pier), the Northern Chautauqua Conservation Club (at the foot of Mullet Street, west of Memorial Park), the foot of Deer and Main Streets (east of the pier), and Lakeside Boulevard (which runs from Main Street to Wright Park, 12 blocks to the east).</p>
